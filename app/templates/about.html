                                The inference engine on this websit allows you to test real time speech recognition inference on the Nvidia Jetson TX2 module for embedded AI computing at the edge. The model consists of a layer of 256 convolutional neurons, 2 layers of 512 bidirectional recurrent neurons, and a layer of time distributed dense neurons. The model was trained using Keras/Tensorflow on an Nvidia GTX 1070 GPU and deployed on an apache web server on a Jetson TX2 using flask in python.

                            <p>
                                There are 3 primary methods for extracting features for speech recognition. This includes using raw audio forms, spectrograms, and mfcc's. For this project, I have created a character level sequence-to-sequence model using spectrograms. This allows me to train a model on a data set with a limited vocabulary that can generalize to more unique/rare words better. This comes at the cost of making a model that is more; computationally expensive, difficult to interpret/understand, succeptible to the problems of vanishing or exploding gradients as the sequences can be quite long.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Raw Audio Waves (pictured above)</h4>
                            <p>This method uses the raw wave forms of the audio files and is a 1D vector where X = [x1, x2, x3...]</p>
                            <h4>Spectrograms</h4>
                            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
                                    <img class="article-image" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/spectrogram.png') }}" border="0" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <p>This transforms the raw audio wave forms into a 2D tensor where the first dimension corresponds to time (the horizontal axis), and the second dimension corresponds to frequency (the verticle axis) rather than amplitude. We lose a little bit of information in this conversion process as we take the log of the power of FFT. This can be written as log |FFT(X)|^2.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Similar to the spectrogram, this turns the audio wave form into a 2D array. This works by mapping the powers of the Fourier transform of the signal, and then taking the discrete cosine transform of the logged mel powers. This produces a 2D array with reduced dimensions when compared to spectrograms, effectively allowing for compression of the spectrogram and speeding up training.</p>

                        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
                                <p>For this project, the architecture chosen is a (Recurrent) Deep Neural Network (RNN) as it is easy to implement, and scales well. At its core, this is a machine translation problem, so an encoder-decoder model is an appropriate framework choice. Recurrent neurons are similar to feedforward neurons, except they also have connections pointing backward. At each step in time, each neuron recieves an input as well as its own output form the previous time step. Each neuron has two sets of weights, one for the input and one for the output at the last time step. Each layer takes vectors as inputs and outputs some vector. This model works by calculating forword propogation through each time step, t, and then back propagation through each time step. At each time step, the speaker is assumed to have spoken 1 of 29 possible characters (26 letters, 1 space character, 1 apostrophe, and 1 blank/empty character used to pad short files since inputs will have varying length). The output of this model at each time step will be a list of probabilitites for each possible character.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Hey, Jetson! is comprised of an acoustic model and language model. The acoustic model scores sequences of acoustic model labels over a time frame and the language model scores sequences of words. A decoding graph then maps valid acoustic label sequences to the corresponding word sequences. Speech recognition is a path search algorithm through the decoding graph, where the score of the path is the sum of the score given to it by the decoding graph, and the score given to it by the acoustic model. So, to put it simply, speech recognition is the process of finding the word sequence that maximizes both the language and acoustic model scores.</p>

                                The loss function I am using is a custom implementation of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), which is a special case of sequential objective functions that addresses some of the modeling burden in cross-entropy that forces the model to link every frame of input data to a label. CTC's label set includes a "blank" symbol in its alphabet so if a frame of data doesn’t contain any utterance, the CTC system can output "blank" indicating that there isn't enough information to classify an output. This also has the added benefits of allowing us to have inputs/outputs of varying length as short files can be padded with the "blank" character. This function only observes the sequence of labels along a path, ignoring the alignment of the labels to the acoustic data.

                                My RNN explores the use of layers of Long-Short Term Memory Cells and Gated Recurrent Units. LSTM's include forget and output gates, which allow more control over the cell's memory by allowing separate control of what is forgotten and what is passed through to the next hidden layer of cells. This will also make it easier to implement 'peepholes' later, which allow the cell to look at both the previous output state and hidden state when making this determination. GRU's are a simplified type of Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neuron with fewer parameters than typical LSTM's. These work via a memory update gate and provide most of the performance of traditional LSTM's at a fraction of the computing cost.

This means that the convolutional layer can pick up on the global context of what it is looking at while still only having as many weights/inputs as the standard form.

                                This model explores connecting two hidden layers of opposite directions to the same output, making their future input information reachable from the current state. To put it simply, this creates two layers of neurons; 1 that goes through the sequence forward in time and 1 that goes through it backward through time. This allows the output layer to get information from past and future states meaning that it will have knowledge of the letters located before and after the current utterance. This can lead to great improvements in performance but comes at a cost of increased latency.

                                Language modeling, the component of a speech recognition system that estimates the prior probabilities of spoken sounds, is the system's knowledge of what probable word sequences are. This system uses a class based language model, which allows it to narrow down its search field through the vocabulary of the speech recognizer (the first part of the system) as it will rarely see a sentence that looks like "the dog the ate sand the water" so it will assume that 'the' is not likely to come after the word 'sand'. We do this by assigning a probability to every possible sentence and then picking the word with the highest prior probability of occurring. Language model smoothing (often called discounting) will help us overcome the problem that this creates a model that will assign a probability of 0 to anything it hasn't witnessed in training. This is done by distributing non zero probabilities over all possible occurences in proportion to the unigram probabilities of words. This overcomes the limitations of traditional n-gram based modeling and is all made possible by the added dimension of time sequences in the recurrent neural network.

                                The best performing model is considered the one that gives the highest probabilities to the words that are actually found in a test set, since it wastes less probability on words that actually occur. The overall cosine similarity of the model's predictions with the ground truth transcriptions in both the test and validation set is about 74%, while the overall word error rate is about 18%.
